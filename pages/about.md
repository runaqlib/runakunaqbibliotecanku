## About Runakunaq Bibliotecanku

Runakunaq Bibliotecanku is in early stages of development! If you would like to report a bug, suggest a new resource, or contribute in any way, please contact [Alía (aliawarsco@nyu.edu)](mailto:aliawarsco@nyu.edu).

Runakunaq Bibliotecanku (The People's Library) is a free, open educational resource created in 2023 using materials from New York University's [Center for Latin American and Caribbean Studies](https://as.nyu.edu/research-centers/clacs.html) Quechua program. The project is created and maintained by [Alía Warsco](aliawars.co), and is further supported by the [Runasimi Outreach Committe](https://www.instagram.com/roc_nyu/?hl=en).

Runakunaq Bibliotecanku operates on the principles of [FAIR](https://www.gofair.foundation/interpretation) + [CARE](https://www.gida-global.org/care), guidelines developed by librarians along with communities. Creators who decide to share their work with Runakunaq Bibliotecanku maintain in perpetuity:

* All rights to their work
* The authority to revoke their permission to share their work with Runakunaq Bibliotecanku
* The authority to change how their work is used, displayed, and distributed
* The authority to change the data and metadata associated with their work

As the creator of Runakunaq Bibliotecanku, I strive to nurture respectful relationships with authors, creators, and communities that create work and allow me to share it. My ethics are supported by the representation and participation of people in their data creation and stewardship. My hope with creating Runakunaq Bibliotecanku is to increase visibility and access to resources about the Andes, Quechua language, and the community of creators that exist within these spaces. Runakunaq Bibliotecanku is a small community of students, researchers, librarians, authors, and creative minds. Most importantly, we are a community of people dedicated to respect, collaboration, and fairness.
